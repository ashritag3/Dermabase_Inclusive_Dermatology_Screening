# Dermabase 🩺🧬  
**An Inclusive, AI-Powered Dermatology Reference & Screening Platform**

Dermabase is a dermatology-focused application designed to improve access, accuracy, and inclusivity in skin condition screening. By combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a diverse, user-contributed image database, Dermabase helps users receive faster, more equitable preliminary skin condition assessments—especially for populations historically underrepresented in dermatology resources.

## 🚨 The Problem

- **3.5 billion people globally lack access to healthcare**
- **9,500 Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer daily**, with ~60% detected too late
- Dermatology visits are often **expensive, inaccessible, and delayed**
- Existing dermatology handbooks and AI tools **lack representation across skin tones**
- This leads to **misdiagnosis and delayed care**, especially for people of color

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Technical Overview)

Dermabase uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with two main stages:

### 1. Feature Extraction
- **Convolution layers** scan small sections of an image to detect patterns
- **Pooling layers** reduce noise and adjust for:
  - Skin tone  
  - Lighting  
  - Shadows  

### 2. Classification
- Extracted features are passed into a neural network
- Uses **supervised learning** to predict conditions based on labeled data
- **Backpropagation** allows the model to learn from errors and improve over time

As more users contribute scans, the model becomes **more accurate and more inclusive**.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. User notices a developing rash or lesion  
2. Opens Dermabase and uploads an image  
3. Receives:
   - Possible diagnoses  
   - Accuracy percentage  
   - Immediate next-step guidance  
4. Views nearby dermatologists specializing in that condition  
5. Tracks condition progression or sets up secure follow-up
